            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I recently got into coding by joining Manchester Codes on their Fast Track Software Developer programme</p>
            <p>I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and using logic and I am really enjoying the course so far.</p>
            <p>I would love one day to be able to move into video game design as this was my dream job</p>
